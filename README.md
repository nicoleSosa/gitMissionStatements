# gitMissionStatements

In this repository, we will be doing the following:

* creating a new branch from the initial commit in main
* adding a a company's mission statement to a file called missionstatement.txt on each of my branches
* alter the original mission statement on only the testing branch to make it more clear
* after finally revising the mission statement, merge the changes and resolve any merging conflicts
* resolving the merge conflicts will ensure that we compare the original and revised mission statements  
* after the comparison, we will decide whether to keep the original mission statement or keep the new changes to it
